# Self Care Pirates

## Description 

Based on our research, out of 133 survey responders 86% of them utilize self-care products, and 60% of them state that self care is highly important to them. However,  due to the lack of readily available male self care information they are not actively engaging in self care consistently. They report that their primary resources for self care advice is Google and friends. 

Self Care Pirates is a wholisting self-care forum for males that gives the users motivation to care for themselves by providing knowledge through fast and reliable resources, which will enable them to take action on their personal care. The forum will allow users to post reviews and recommendations for self care products and techniques. The forum will have an up-vote feature that gives the users the ability to give positive feedback. This app will be a safe space to discuss everything that is related to menâ€™s self care from self-development to makeup. 

The app does not require the user to register to view the forum, but if the user wants to interact, they will be required to create an account or log-in. Once the user is logged in they are able to personalize their user profile, up-vote posts, and post their own comments/reviews. 

## User Story:
Men want a straightforward and reliable website to find information about self-care, where they can share their personal experiences and reviews. Men deserve a positive community to discuss and research self care, and finally stop using 4-in-one shampoo.
